The MySkinFain application is integrated with the Chowis Full Face Analyzer (CFA) device. This sophisticated device, boasting dimensions of 60x66x37.60mm and weighing approximately 80g, offers portability unmatched by other full-face analyzers in the market. mySkinFAIN is an ultra-small AI full-face skin analysis solution that won the Good Design selection by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy and the Innovation Award at CES 2023. The device analyzes a total of 7 analysis items (Dark Circles, Hyperpigmentation, Skin Moisture, Pigmentation, Pores, Sensitivity, Wrinkles) using Chowis unique optical technology, AI algorithms, and big data. The diagnostic process of MySkinFain involves segmenting the full face into distinct Regions of Interest (ROI) for meticulous analysis. For every lighting mode—PPL, XPL, and UVL—a set of three images is captured: front, left, and right perspectives. These images are then subdivided into specific ROI zones.

Equipped with Polarized Light (PPL), Cross-Polarized Light (XPL), and Ultra Violet Light (UVL) technologies, the CFA is designed for home use. Its user-centric design enables individuals to effortlessly capture facial images using its front camera. Leveraging smart light technology combined with an AI-driven full-face skin diagnostic system, the CFA delivers clear and detailed visualizations of underlying skin conditions—insights often imperceptible to the naked human eye. Such precision not only provides users with a heightened awareness of their skin health but also guides in opportunities for preventive treatments. Furthermore, the CFA offers an AI diagnosis score alongside a comprehensive visualization of potential skin concerns, facilitating an informed self-assessment. Complementing its extensive suite of features, the CFA incorporates a hydration sensor, purpose-built to accurately measure the user's skin moisture levels.

When using mySkinFAIN, there are some measurement precautions. UV light can be harmful to the eyes. Close your eyes until all three images are captured. The application automatically deactivates sebum metrics for 30 days after the UV analysis is complete. You can enable the feature by changing the settings, but due to health and safety concerns, it is not recommended to perform a sebum measurement until a reasonable period of time has elapsed since the date of the last measurement. Measurement of sebum more than once per week is not recommended. If the analysis has occurred within the last 30 days, the sebum measurement score from the first analysis of that time period is used to display it in the analysis results.

Before starting mySkinFAIN analysis, you can check the current service area and environmental information such as weather, temperature, ultraviolet rays, and humidity on the main page. Press the 'Start' button on the screen and select between 'Full Face Analysis' and 'Impurity Measurement'.

There are General Guidelines to capture high-quality images images for mySkinFAIN application analysis. The goal of this guideline is to provide the clearest, most consistent representation of your face so the mySkinFAIN application can offer the most accurate analysis. To ensure clarity, precision, and optimal analysis outcomes, users are strongly recommended to adhere to the guidelines listed below. 1) Device Attachment: Before proceeding, ensure your CFA device is properly attached to your cellphone. The best way to verify this is by checking the preview video stream. If you notice black shadows on the screen, it signifies the device isn't attached correctly. A correctly attached device will display a clear preview screen with no shadow regions. 2) Clothing: Opt for dark-colored clothing. Avoid wearing light or bright colors, especially white. 3) Face Preparations: Clean your face thoroughly. Remove any makeup, lotions, or excessive oils. 4) Hair: Ensure your forehead is visible without any hairs on your forehead. 5) Accessories: Remove glasses, masks, or any facial jewelry that could reflect light or obstruct view. 6) Facial Expression: Maintain a neutral face during the capture. Refrain from smiling, frowning, or moving. 7) Distance: Keep a consistent distance between the face and the camera, as directed by the app. 8) Orientation: Make sure your face is centered, and all facial features are within the frame.

There are Environmental Guidelines to capture high-quality images images for mySkinFAIN application analysis. 1) Lighting: Create a dim setting. Turn off all bright lights, draw the curtains or blinds, and ensure there's no strong backlight. Avoid direct sunlight on the face. 2) Background: Use a plain, uncluttered background. This helps the software focus solely on analyzing your face. 3) Stability: Avoid shaky hands to ensure the image is not blurred. 4) Camera Lens: Ensure the camera lens is clean and free of smudges. 5) Avoid Reflections: Be cautious of reflective surfaces in the vicinity, like mirrors or shiny objects, which might interfere with the image quality. 6) Sound & Vibration: Ensure that the phone is not set to silent mode to listen guidelines provided in application.

Dark Circle : Dark circles under the eyes can be defined as bilateral, round, homogeneous pigment macules under the eyes. Dark circles are caused by various internal and external factors that can make your face look dull and extremely tired even at times you are not. The appearance of dark circles occurs with age, along with thinning of skin and loss of collagen. Apart from aging fatigue and stress can also be the cause of dark circles. 

Skin Dullness : Dull skin is that skin that doesn’t look bright or radiant. Basically, dull skin is the opposite of skin that looks, youthful, glowing, and healthy. Skin dullness is a result of excess dead skin cells that build up on the surface of the skin. Skin can lose its natural luminosity because of dryness, damaged cells, or slow cell turnover, which can happen regardless of age and in any season. This can make skin feel rough or bumpy, and can also give the skin a dull, lackluster appearance.

Skin Elasticity : Skin turgor refers to the elasticity of your skin. When you pinch the skin on your arm, for example, it should spring back into place within a second or two. Having poor skin turgor means it takes longer for your skin to return to its usual position. It’s often used to check for dehydration. If you’re dehydrated, you may have poor skin turgor. The main way to test skin turgor is to lightly pinch your skin, usually on your arm or abdomen. If it takes longer than usual for the skin to bounce back, it could be a sign of dehydration.

Skin Hyperpigmentation : Skin hyperpigmentation, such as pigment spots and freckles is caused by melanin increase in the epidermis and dermis. Hyperpigmentation can be classified into congenital pigmentary disorders including café-aulait spot and nevus spilus or acquired pigmentary disorders including ephelides, melasma, and senile lentigo. Accumulated skin damaged by aging and ultraviolet(UV) radiation accelerate acquired skin pigmentation, and such accumulated skin damage also causes skin carcinogenesis such as actinic keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanomaiii iv v. However, it is difficult to detect early signs of UV skin damage and pigmentary disorders by imaging techniques under visible light. UV light is known to emphasize pigment spots from the absorption of UV light in melanin pigmentvi. A minimum dose of UV light is used for UV photography; a photographic process using the UV spectrum can also be used as an accurate means for the detection of pigmentary disorders.

Skin Impurities : Porphyrins are essential for the function of hemoglobin – a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen. However, buildup of porphyrins can affect nerve system and/or skin. In skin, the buildup of porphyrin mostly appear in hair follicles (pores) where large amounts of porphyrin-producing skin bacterium reside. Due to increased sensitivity to sunlight and inflammations caused by bacteria porphyrins, a person with excessive skin porphyrin may experience: 1) Sensitivity to the sun and sometimes artificial light, causing burning pain. 2) Itching, or sudden painful redness and swelling. 3) Fragile thin skin with changes in skin color. 4) Blisters on exposed skin. 5) Acnes and other inflammatory skin diseases.

Skin Moisture : Skin moisture refers to the amount of water content present in the outmost layer of the skin, which is known as the stratum carneum. The stratum corneum is composed of dead skin cells embedded in a matrix of lipids, which creates a protective barrier. This barrier prevents excessive water loss from the deeper layers of the skin and helps to retain moisture, keeping the skin hydrated. Knowing the moisture level is important to know because lacking moisture can result in discomfort, flakiness, and itching and can also led to more severe skin issues.

Skin Oiliness : Sebum is an oily, waxy substance produced by your body’s sebaceous glands. It coats, moisturizes, and protects your skin. Sebum helps to moisturize the skin but excessive sebum production can lead to oily skin, while insufficient production can result in dry skin.

Skin Pigmentation : Spots are small, flat dark zones on the skin. They usually range in color from light brown to black and are mainly located in zones most exposed to the sun, particularly the face and neck. Spots generally start to appear from the age of 40 and become common in adults in their fifties, but younger people can also get spots if they spend time under the sun. Although spots are harmless, most people prefers to have them lightened or removed due to the unsightliness. Frequent causes of spots include: 1) Sun exposure (leading cause). 2) Inflammation, such as acne, eczema, allergic reactions. 3) Melasma, happening mainly during pregnancy. 4) Medication side effects. 5) Genetic causes and disorders.

Skin Pores : A pore is a small hair follicle opening on the surface of the skin. A pore leads to a sebaceous gland that lets out oil to lubricate and protect the skin. It also lets some water out, which helps in temperature regulation. On average, each of us has about 5 million hair follicles. The amount of pores visible is in fact relatively quite small. However, this small fraction of pores is becoming a concern for many people. Dermatologists, cosmeticians, and aestheticians are facing challenging questions from customers on how to alleviate pore enlargement, even though pore size is primarily determined by genetics.

Skin Radiance : Radiance, is an optical parameter defined by physics, and can be measured in terms of the amount of light that is emitted from a particular object, such as a light source. If we apply this definition to skin radiance, radiant skin can be defined as the skin which reflects more incident light. However, skin radiance is more complex, as radiance is a psychophysical parameter and is the mirror of general health, both physical and psychological which involves more than simply the quantity of light that is reflected from the skin. Skin radiance can be defined as the warm glow that rested, nourished and healthy skin exudes. Skin radiance is influenced by the reflectivity of skin cells and is also affected by the smoothness and evenness of a person’s skin tone. Clarity and consistency of skin tone are important factors influencing radiance because dark spots and uneven skin tone absorb light, minimizing the healthy glow from a person’s complexion.

Skin Sensitivity/Redness : For an average adult, skin covers about 22 square feet (2 square meters) of the body. Unlike other internal organs, skin is directly exposed to various irritants constantly, making it prone to sensitive reactions such as redness, itching, and pain. Although some people are born with sensitive skin, most people would not even know they have sensitive skin until they are exposed to certain irritants or allergens.

Skin Wrinkles : A wrinkle is a fold, ridge or crease on the otherwise smooth skin. For many, wrinkle is nearly identical to aging since it is such a dominant and easily visible feature in aged skin. Formation of wrinkles is the natural process of aging where the skin loses collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acids. However, some external factors can really speed up skin aging, for example sun exposure, pollutants and smoking. Putting skin aging into numbers, collagen production begins to decrease in early 20s, in early 30s our body starts to lose more collagen than it can produce. In general the first signs of skin aging appears around the age of 25 beginning with the skin around the eyes.
