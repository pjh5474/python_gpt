      "\u001b[33;1m\u001b[1;3mOn 29 March 2024, software developer Andres Freund reported that he had found a maliciously introduced backdoor in the Linux utility xz within the liblzma library in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 released in February 2024.While xz is commonly present in most Linux distributions, the backdoor only targeted Debian- and RPM-based systems running on the x86-64 architecture. At the time of discovery the backdoored version had not yet been widely deployed to production systems, but was present in development versions of major distributions.The backdoor gives an attacker who possesses a specific Ed448 private key remote code execution capabilities on the affected Linux system. The issue has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Background ==\n",
      "Microsoft employee and PostgreSQL developer Andres Freund reported the backdoor after investigating a performance regression in Debian Sid. Freund noticed that SSH connections were generating an unexpectedly high amount of CPU usage as well as causing errors in Valgrind, a memory debugging tool. Freund reported his finding to Openwall Project's open source security mailing list, which brought it to the attention of various software vendors. There is evidence that the attacker made efforts to obfuscate the code, as the backdoor consists of multiple stages that act together.Once the compromised version is incorporated into the operating system, it alters the behavior of OpenSSH's SSH server daemon by abusing the systemd library, allowing the attacker to gain the same level of access as any authorized administrator. According to the analysis by Red Hat, the backdoor can \"enable a malicious actor to break sshd authentication and gain unauthorized access to the entire system remotely\".A subsequent investigation found that the campaign to insert the backdoor into the XZ Utils project was a culmination of approximately three years of effort by a user going by the name Jia Tan and the nickname JiaT75 to gain access to a position of trust within the project. After a period of pressure on the founder and head maintainer to hand over the control of the project via apparent sock puppetry Jia Tan gained the position of co-maintainer of XZ Utils and was able to sign off on version 5.6.0, which introduced the backdoor, and version 5.6.1, which patched some anomalous behavior that can be apparent during software testing of the operating system. Some of the suspected sock puppetry pseudonyms are Jigar Kumar, krygorin4545, and misoeater91. It is suspected that the names Jia Tan, as well as the supposed code author Hans Jansen (for versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1) are simply names invented by participants of the campaign. Neither have any sort of visible public presence in software development beyond the short few years of the campaign. The backdoor was notable for its level of sophistication and for the fact that the perpetrator practiced a high level of operational security for a long period of time while working to attain a position of trust. American security researcher Dave Aitel has suggested that it fits the pattern attributable to APT29, an advanced persistent threat actor believed to be working on behalf of the Russian SVR. Others have suggested that it could be any state actor or a non-state actor of considerable resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Mechanism ==\n",
      "The malicious code is known to be in 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 releases of the XZ Utils software package. The exploit remains dormant unless a specific third-party patch of the SSH server is used. Under the right circumstances this interference could potentially enable a malicious actor to break sshd authentication and gain unauthorized access to the entire system remotely. The malicious mechanism consists of two compressed test files that contain the malicious binary code. These files are available in the git repository, but remain dormant unless extracted and injected into the program. The code uses the glibc IFUNC mechanism to replace an existing function \n",

      "XZ Utils (previously LZMA Utils) is a set of free software command-line lossless data compressors, including the programs lzma and xz, for Unix-like operating systems and, from version 5.0 onwards, Microsoft Windows. For compression/decompression the Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) is used. XZ Utils started as a Unix port of Igor Pavlov's LZMA-SDK that has been adapted to fit seamlessly into Unix environments and their usual structure and behavior.\n",

      "XZ Utils can compress and decompress the xz and lzma file formats. Since the LZMA format has been considered legacy,\n",
      "XZ Utils by default compresses to xz.\n",
      "In most cases, xz achieves higher compression rates than alternatives like gzip and bzip2. Decompression speed is higher than bzip2, but lower than gzip. Compression can be much slower than gzip, and is slower than bzip2 for high levels of compression, and is most useful when a compressed file will be used many times.XZ Utils consists of two major components:\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Usage ==\n",
      "Both the behavior of the software and the properties of the file format have been designed to work similarly to those of the popular Unix compressing tools gzip and bzip2.\n",
      "Just like gzip and bzip, xz and lzma can only compress single files (or data streams) as input. They cannot bundle multiple files into a single archive –  to do this an archiving program is used first, such as tar.\n",

      "Decompressing the archive:\n",
      "\n",
      "Version 1.22 or greater of the GNU implementation of tar has transparent support for tarballs compressed with lzma and xz, using the switches --xz or -J for xz compression, and --lzma for LZMA compression.\n",

      "Single-letter tar example for archive with compress and decompress with extract using short suffix:\n",

      "xz has supported multi-threaded compression (with the -T flag) since 2014, version 5.2.0; since version 5.4.0 threaded decompression has been implemented. Threaded decompression requires multiple compressed blocks within a stream which are created by the threaded compression interface. The number of threads can be less than defined if the file is not big enough for threading with the given settings or if using more threads would exceed the memory usage limit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== The xz format ==\n",
      "The xz format improves on lzma by allowing for preprocessing filters. The exact filters used are similar to those used in 7z, as 7z's filters are available in the public domain via the LZMA SDK.\n",

      "== Development and adoption ==\n",
      "Development of XZ Utils took place within the Tukaani Project, a small group of developers who once maintained a Linux distribution based on Slackware.\n",
      "All of the source code for xz and liblzma has been released into the public domain. The XZ Utils source distribution additionally includes some optional scripts and an example program that are subject to various versions of the GNU General Public License (GPL). The resulting software xz and liblzma binaries are public domain, unless the optional LGPL getopt implementation is incorporated.Binaries are available for FreeBSD, NetBSD, Linux systems, Microsoft Windows, and FreeDOS. A number of Linux distributions, including Fedora, Slackware, Ubuntu, and Debian use xz for compressing their software packages. Arch Linux previously used xz to compress packages, but as of December 27, 2019, packages are compressed with Zstandard compression. Fedora Linux also switched to compressing its RPM packages with Zstandard with Fedora Linux 31. The GNU FTP archive also uses xz.\n",
